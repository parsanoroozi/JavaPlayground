     * Swing is now the official name for the non-peer-based GUI toolkit
     *
     * Swing is not a complete replacement for the AWTâ€”it is built on top of
     * the AWT architecture.
     *
     * of course swing is slower than awt (peer based components used by awt)
     * reasons to use swing over awt: 1)more ui elements 2)has few dependencies 3)consistent ux across platforms
     *
     * SWT is a graphical toolkit similar to awt that eclipse uses instead of swing
